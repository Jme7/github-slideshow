# How to add a slide

Go to posts folder and add 0000-00-[NUMBER OF SLIDE]-{USERNAME}.md for a new slide 

This course is using the open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.

## IMPOATANT
I made almost NONE of this project, I just had this as my github learning course and thought it might be a good template, so I made a few SMALL changes, and set it as a template. Again, I DIDN'T MAKE THIS PROJECT. Look at the contributers, and everyone on the right made this project, except for me.
