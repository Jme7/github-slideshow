# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Go to posts folder and add 0000_00_[NUMBER OF SLIDE]-{USERNAME}.md for a new slide 

This course is using the open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
